The Donchian Trend Ribbon is a custom technical analysis indicator built using Pine Script on TradingView. This indicator enhances the traditional Donchian Channel, originally created by Richard Donchian, by visualizing trends with color-coded ribbons. The goal of this indicator is to provide traders with an easy-to-read representation of trend direction, helping them identify potential breakouts, reversals, and market volatility.

Features
Donchian Channel Integration: The Donchian Channel calculates the highest high and the lowest low over a specified period. The Donchian Trend Ribbon builds upon this by offering additional visual cues for price action relative to these boundaries.
Color-Coded Trend Visualization:
Green Ribbon: Indicates an uptrend when the price is above the upper Donchian boundary.
Red Ribbon: Signals a downtrend when the price is below the lower Donchian boundary.
Neutral Color: For price movements within the Donchian Channel range, helping traders avoid false breakouts.
Dynamic Ribbon Layering: The indicator plots multiple layers of ribbons at different levels, creating a dynamic "ribbon" effect that displays how price action evolves over time.
Adjustable Parameters: Users can easily modify the Donchian Channel period and ribbon settings to adapt the indicator to different market conditions and trading strategies.
Trend Detection: Visual identification of trend direction and potential reversals based on price interactions with the highest high and lowest low levels.
How It Works
Donchian Channel Calculation: The indicator calculates the highest high and lowest low over the specified period (default: 20 periods).
Trend Identification: It compares the current price against the upper and lower Donchian Channel boundaries to determine the market's trend.
If the price closes above the upper boundary, an uptrend is signaled.
If the price closes below the lower boundary, a downtrend is signaled.
If the price remains within the channel, no significant trend is identified.
Ribbon Plotting: The indicator plots a series of color-coded ribbons at various levels on the chart, indicating the strength and direction of the trend over time.
Use Cases
Trend Following: Traders can use the Donchian Trend Ribbon to follow market trends, entering long positions when the green ribbon appears (uptrend) and short positions when the red ribbon appears (downtrend).
Breakout Trading: The indicator is useful for detecting breakouts as the price moves outside the Donchian Channel's boundaries, providing a clear visual cue.
Reversal Identification: The color change in the ribbon signals potential trend reversals, helping traders adjust their positions or exit trades at optimal times.
Volatility Assessment: The spacing between the highest and lowest points of the Donchian Channel can indicate periods of increased or decreased market volatility.
